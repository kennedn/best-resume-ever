about: I have built a career on exploring rabbit holes. As it turns out, rabbits come in many colours and I have yet to find one that did not have something to offer. I have had as much fun trying to perfect my latest cooking endeavour as I've had trying to digest the broad strokes of quantum mechanics. In applying this same exploratory enthusiasm to computing I have found my life's work. For over a decade I have been delving deeper and deeper into the field of computing. From games development to container orchestration to signal processing I have with each step been building holistic knowledge of the field. In recent years I have finally made it down to the metal, exploring concepts such as Embedded C, Programmable IO and FPGA design through my personal projects.
